# CavityFlowNumpyOnly
2D Cavity Flow Simulation only depends on python numpy
The Source code and techniques are modified from 
https://github.com/mathworks/2D-Lid-Driven-Cavity-Flow-Incompressible-Navier-Stokes-Solver.git
This work is a re-implement of matlab work
Anything about solving linear equations is replaced by numpy FFT solver
And the stem of this work can be transplanted into cupy module.
